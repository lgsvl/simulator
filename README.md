# A ROS/ROS2 Multi-robot Simulator for Autonomous Vehicles

## Summary

We present a Unity-based multi-robot simulator for autonomous vehicle developers. We provide an open-source, out-of-the-box solution which can meet the needs of developers wishing to focus on testing their autonomous vehicle algorithms. It currently has integration with the MIT DuckieTown and Autoware platforms, can generate HD maps, and be immediately used for testing and validation of a whole system with little need for custom integrations. We hope to build a collaborative community among robotics and autonomous vehicle developers by open sourcing our efforts.

## Build

Build steps for Ubuntu host:

1. Install Unity 2018.2.4f1:
 https://beta.unity3d.com/download/fe703c5165de/public_download.html

 install into the /opt/Unity folder:
```
 chmod +x ~/Downloads/UnitySetup-2018.2.4f1
 ./UnitySetup-2018.2.4f1 --unattended --install-location=/opt/Unity --components=Unity,Windows-Mono
```
 run Unity and make sure it's activated

2. Make sure you have git-lfs installed: https://git-lfs.github.com/

3. Clone simulator from GitHub:
```
 git lfs clone https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator.git
```

4. Cd into the main cloned folder and run build:
```
 mkdir build
 /opt/Unity/Editor/Unity \
    -batchmode \
    -nographics \
    -silent-crashes \
    -quit \
    -buildDestination ./build/simulator \
    -buildTarget Linux64 \
    -executeMethod BuildScript.Build \
    -projectPath . \
    -logFile /dev/stdout
```

Test simulator:

5. Run rosbridge:
```
   roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
```

6. Run simulator from build/simulator
   Choose "Free Roaming" -> "DuckieDowntown" as map -> "Duckiebot-duckietown-ros1" as robot
   make sure it's connected, click "RUN" - make sure it's running, you can operate the robot

7. Run rviz or rqt_image_view and see image from topic "/simulator/camera_node/image/compressed"
