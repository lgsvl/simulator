## Introduction

LG Electronics America R&D Center has developed an HDRP Unity-based multi-robot simulator for autonomous vehicle developers. 
We provide an out-of-the-box solution which can meet the needs of developers wishing to focus on testing their autonomous vehicle algorithms. 
It currently has integration with TierIV's [Autoware](https://github.com/lgsvl/Autoware) and Baidu's [Apollo 5.0](https://github.com/lgsvl/apollo-5.0)
and [Apollo 3.0](https://github.com/lgsvl/apollo) platforms, can generate HD maps, and can be immediately used for testing and validation of a whole system with little need for custom integrations. 
We hope to build a collaborative community among robotics and autonomous vehicle developers by open sourcing our efforts. 

*To use the simulator with Apollo, first download the simulator binary, then follow the guide on our [Apollo 5.0 fork](https://github.com/lgsvl/apollo-5.0).*

*To use the simulator with Autoware, first download the simulator binary, then follow the guide on our [Autoware fork](https://github.com/lgsvl/Autoware).*

## Getting Started

You can find complete and the most up-to-date guides on our [documentation website](https://www.lgsvlsimulator.com/docs).

Running the simulator with reasonable performance and frame rate (for perception related tasks) requires a high performance desktop. Below is the recommended system for running the simulator at high quality. We are currently working on performance improvements for a better experience. 

**Recommended system:**

- 4 GHz Quad Core CPU
- Nvidia GTX 1080, 8GB GPU memory
- Windows 10 64 Bit

The easiest way to get started with running the simulator is to download our [latest release](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases/latest) and run as a standalone executable.

For the latest functionality or if you want to modify the simulator for your own needs, you can checkout our source, open it as a project in Unity, and run inside the Unity Editor. Otherwise, you can build the Unity project into a standalone executable.

Currently, running the simulator in Windows yields better performance than running on Linux. 

### Downloading and starting simulator

1. Download the latest release of the LGSVL Simulator for your supported operating system (Windows or Linux) here: [https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases/latest](https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator/releases/latest)
2. Unzip the downloaded folder and run the executable.
3. If you are running on Linux, make sure you have Vulkan userspace library installed:

`
    sudo apt-get install libvulkan1
` 
### Building and running from source

**NOTE**: to clone repository faster, clone only single branch.

To get latest code from master branch:

    git clone --single-branch https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator.git

Alternatively, you can get source code of specific release. Here is an example how to checkout by release tag `2020.03`

    git clone https://github.com/lgsvl/simulator.git
    cd simulator
    git checkout 2020.03

Check out our instructions for getting started with building from source [here](Docs/docs/build-instructions.md).


## Simulator Instructions

1. After starting the simulator, you should see a button to open the UI in the browser. 
2. Go to the Simulations tab and select the appropriate map and vehicle.  For a standard setup, select "BorregasAve" for map and "Jaguar2015XE (Apollo 5.0)" for vehicle. Click "Run" to begin.
3. The vehicle/robot should spawn inside the map environment that was selected. Read [here](Docs/docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md) for an explanation of all current keyboard shortcuts and controls.
4. Follow the guides on our respective [Autoware](https://github.com/lgsvl/Autoware) and [Apollo 5.0](https://github.com/lgsvl/apollo-5.0) repositories for instructions on running the platforms with the simulator.
